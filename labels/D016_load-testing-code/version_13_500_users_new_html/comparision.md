  🎉 Comparison Analysis: Old vs New Code

  Success Rate Improvement

  - Old Code (version_12): 2 failures out of 238 requests = 99.2% success rate
  - New Code (version_13): 0 failures out of 252 requests = 100% success rate ✅

  Key Performance Metrics

  | Metric                | Old Code | New Code | Improvement          |
  |-----------------------|----------|----------|----------------------|
  | Total Requests        | 238      | 252      | +14 requests (+5.9%) |
  | Total Failures        | 2        | 0        | -100% failures ✅    |
  | Requests/sec          | 4.32     | 4.71     | +9% throughput ✅    |
  | Average Response Time | 9,443ms  | 9,847ms  | +404ms (+4.3%)       |

  Failure Analysis

  - Old Code: Had CatchResponseError('HTTP 0') errors (2 occurrences)
  - New Code: Zero failures - completely eliminated the HTTP 0 errors ✅

  Response Time Analysis

  - Stream endpoint: Very similar (2033ms vs 2019ms)
  - Application logic: New code slightly slower but more reliable
  - Overall: The 4% response time increase is acceptable given the 100% reliability gain

  🏆 Key Insights

  1. Reliability Fixed: Your new code completely eliminated the connection failures
  2. Throughput Improved: +9% more requests per second
  3. Trade-off: Slightly higher response times but perfect reliability
  4. Early Exit Success: The KeyboardInterrupt approach worked perfectly for both versions!

  🎯 Conclusion

  Your new code is a clear improvement:
  - ✅ Perfect reliability (0% failure rate)
  - ✅ Higher throughput (+9% req/s)
  - ✅ Proper error handling (no more HTTP 0 errors)
  - ⚠️ Slight latency increase (+4%, acceptable trade-off)

  The fact that your new code handles 500 concurrent users with zero failures while the old code had connection issues shows that your
  refactoring was very successful!

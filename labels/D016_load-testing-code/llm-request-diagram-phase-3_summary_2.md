# Performance Enhancement Summary

## Approach We Took

Our performance enhancement followed a systematic 5-step process:

```text
[1. test] -> [2. refactor] -> [3. test] -> [4. flaw] -> [5. improve]
```

1. **Running load testing** - Establish baseline performance metrics
2. **Refactor to reduce server side processing** - Move processing to client side
3. **Run load test again** - Validate performance improvements
4. **Discover the interval issue** - Found performance gains caused request multiplication
5. **Refine approach to have consistent interval** - Protect request count patterns

---

## Overall Improvements

### 1. Move Chunk Processing to Client Side

- **Before**: Server processed all streaming chunks
- **After**: Client handles chunk processing, server acts as proxy
- **Limitation**: Cannot avoid server side cutting "data: " due to EventSourceResponse's implementation

### 2. Test Segregation - stream, batch, tools

Separated testing into three distinct categories:

- **Stream tests** - Pure streaming functionality
- **Batch tests** - Non-streaming requests
- **Tool tests** - Tool orchestration scenarios

### 3. Unified Test Tool Usage - 1 user, many user -> locust

- **Decision**: Only use Locust for all testing
- **Replaced**: pytest-benchmark (slow) with Locust (fast)
- **Result**: Consistent methodology across all test types

### 4. Response Chunk Count Strategy - no python client code

- **Old approach**: Full JSON parsing and content validation
- **New approach**: Simple chunk counting (>2 chunks = success)
- **Benefit**: Avoid expensive client-side processing during load tests

### 5. User Request Interval as Parameter - (3~10) + x = 15

#### How It Works

- Active users make repeated requests throughout test duration
- Each user follows a consistent interval pattern
- **New rule**: `interval = 20 - time_taken`

#### Problem Without Intervals

Performance enhancement ended up making many times more requests per user:

- Faster responses -> Users complete requests quicker -> More requests per time period
- **Example**: 4x performance improvement = 4x more requests per user

#### Solution

```
Max Interval: 20 seconds
Request Time: 3 seconds
Wait Time: 17 seconds
Total Cycle: 20 seconds (consistent)
```

### 6. Discovery Solution Strategy - batch; tool; stream (cannot revive)

We developed different strategies for different request types:

| Request Type       | Strategy                | Approach                               | Reason                                                    |
|--------------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Batch Requests** | Capacity Discovery      | Traditional load testing               | No connection limits, can find true capacity              |
| **Tool Calling**   | Deterministic Discovery | Fixed tool count (e.g. 2 tools)        | Predictable duration enables capacity discovery           |
| **Streaming**      | Fixed Load Comparison   | 200 users, 20s interval, temperature=0 | Windows connection limits prevent true capacity discovery |

#### Batch Requests

- Current discovery process is still valuable
- Traditional request-response pattern works well
- Can discover actual API capacity limits

#### Tool Calling

- Can be made deterministic with known number of tool calls
- Backend configuration for consistent test scenarios (documentation to be added later)
- Same discovery process works due to predictable patterns

#### Streaming

- Different territory due to connection limitations
- **Strategy**: Fix parameters (200 users, 20-second intervals)
- **Measurement**: Use request duration as comparison metric
- **Consistency**: Always set temperature=0 for maximum consistency
- **Focus**: Response time comparison between versions rather than absolute capacity

### 7. Failure Threshold Enhancement

#### The Problem

- Windows file descriptor limits cause server crashes at high loads
- Manual monitoring required to stop tests before crashes
- Inconsistent data collection due to server failures
- Performance improvements only visible at maximum stress
- Use the equivalent of `Ctrl + C` to exit the test, because this guarantees html report generation

#### The Solution

**Configurable Early Termination**:
```bash
# Default: 5 failure threshold
./run_load_testing_ollama_stream_8min.sh

# Custom threshold
export LOAD_TEST_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=3
./run_load_testing_ollama_stream_8min.sh

# Disabled (old behavior)
export LOAD_TEST_FAILURE_THRESHOLD=0
./run_load_testing_ollama_stream_8min.sh
```

#### Implementation

- **Real-time monitoring**: Tracks failure count during test execution
- **Automatic termination**: Stops test when threshold reached
- **Clean data collection**: Results contain only pre-crash performance data
- **Server protection**: Prevents crashes and data corruption

#### Benefits

1. **Consistent Testing**: Always stops at same failure point for fair comparisons
2. **Automated Operation**: Can run unattended without manual intervention
3. **Clean Performance Data**: Get results right before Windows FD limit
4. **Server Health**: Prevents crashes that require manual recovery

#### Results with Threshold Testing

Using 500-user stress tests with failure threshold, we measured:

- **Old version**: Failed at 270 users, 412 total requests, 41.3% failure rate
- **New version**: Failed at 305 users, 499 total requests, 55.5% failure rate
- **Improvement**: +35 users capacity (+13%), +87 more requests (+21%), 1s faster response time

This demonstrates that the optimization provides **measurable performance improvements** under maximum stress conditions.

The piece needs to work as part of the fundraising pack whilst also sharing enough information that it can be shared separately and still have the same impact. Work within the postal constraints in terms of size and weight. Include the commissioned artwork of the 100-year vision by William H Jones. ‘We were delighted to work with Net on our recent campaign to save Skiddaw Forest. As well as being everything you’d expect from a design agency: creative, experience and dependable, the team fully understood our need to work to a tight budget and schedule, and never compromised on a design or service’ ANDREA SIMPSON CUMBRIA WILDLIFE TRUST BRIEFING Raising funds for nature recovery Whether you do it regularly or it’s your first time, fundraising is hard. Add into the equation the current financial climate of the country and a large sum of money required, it makes it even harder. Cumbria Wildlife Trust came to us to help them create awareness and raise funds for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for the Trust and Cumbria’s wildlife. Here’s what we did… NATASHA GRINDLEY SENIOR GRAPHIC DESIGNER GRAPHIC DESIGN The challenge There were several things we had to take into consideration including commissioned artwork from William H Jones showing the “100-year vision” was to be incorporated; the size and weight needed to fit within a C5 envelope and be no heavier than 100g when posting to avoid issues with Royal Mail; and it needed to be different from the ‘norm’ without being ostentatious. The fundraising pack needed to include the main campaign handout, an introductory letter and a traditional donation form, all contained and posted within a designed C5 envelope. “100-YEAR VISION” BY CUMBRIAN ARTIST WILLIAM H JONES PRINT DESIGN The finished piece After considering different options, Cumbria Wildlife Trust selected an A5 landscape Maltese cross mailer with a custom-cut design depicting geographical contours and featuring the Skiddaw mountain range. This was complemented by a custom illustration that was used on the welcome letter and the envelope. Print and production was provided by local printers MTP Media. DESIGN THAT MATTERS Results Working on the fundraising campaign for Cumbria Wildlife Trust was a special project for us. It was exciting to work through the challenges and specifications whilst working towards the delivery deadline. The brief allowed us to explore various options for printing techniques, folding options, and die-cutting, as well as testing how far we could push the design within the different options. By collaborating with CWT, we had the opportunity to raise awareness about the importance of nature recovery and engage with the local and wider community. We were delighted to see how well the campaign was received, and how quickly the funds were raised to help the Trust successfully purchase Skiddaw Forest and begin the journey to nature recovery within the area.

Stacey Penrose Osprey Meadow PHASE 1 Web Design When designing the website for Osprey Meadows we wanted to incorporate their current colour palette but update it to more reflect the relaxing nature of their business.

The icon set was simplified to work at a glance but each item can be clicked on for more information. We also created an interactive map that people could access before their visit to familiarise themselves with the facilities and locations before arrival. A printable version of this map was also included in a welcome pack when guests arrive. Stefan Ritson Creative Director PHASE 4 Email Marketing overwhelm the client.

Home Who What Work Blog Contact Powering Your Potential Branding Video Marketing Web Development Website Design Objectives Breathe new life into business with brand refresh to better represent future ambitions. Support new branding with professional and functional website. Develop online training tools and personal development platform. Help the brand transition their existing strategy into a more online focused operation. Working with the team at Net has been seamless. Not only do they take the time to understand your needs and vision but they also use their skills and experience to (very politely) let you know if your idea needs pivoting. I trust them implicitly and have valued their input throughout the time we have worked together. They put their heart and soul into all of their projects and always go above and beyond. Thank you Net for being amazing! Nicole Bilham PYP PHASE 1 Branding Powering your potential offer a wild range of services that ripple out and affect more people that the person they work with. It was important for us to show this in their brand identity. The logo features a ripple type mark to represent this with he person being the central point. It was important to also have a shorter version of their logo as they had become known in their marked as PYP. A strong colour palette helps tie everything together and gives a cohesive feel to all things related to the brand identity. Stefan Ritson Creative Director PHASE 2 Website Design The website needed to hold a lot of information while also maintaining a simple bite size approach as to not overwhelm the client. The colours and large graphics are used to break up the information in to smaller palatable snippets that allow you to scan for what is important to you as a viewer and read more in depth the specific information you are looking for. It was important to use lots of illustrations to represent elements of what they do and the colour palette helped us to keep this cohesive. Stefan Ritson Creative Director PHASE 3 Development Powering Your Potential has a number of great self-improvement materials to work with that we were keen to put into interactive on site tools that users could benefit from in a light and engaging way. Ranging from questionnaires to interactive forms, we worked with PYP to present them in an easy yet modern way for visitors to use again and again. Cassia Sadler Trainee Developer PHASE 4 Video Marketing To help bring some of the real life results and impact both Steve and Andy have already had onto their website, we created a short testimonial video. Serving to build trust and champion the incredible work both guys do to help those looking for purpose, it features animation, talking heads and a professional opening that harmonises with the new look branding. Liam Bland Digital Marketing Manager Results Charismatic duo Steve and Andy are an absolute joy to work with. From the ground up, this project has been absorbing in all the right ways, pushing our talents in web design, branding and video marketing to deliver a professional space they can market to future clients. Central to that outcome was the need to keep the site future proof, a space that can be expanded over time to include their growing list of resources, such as; blogs, videos, seminars and even interactive courses. What we have created hosts all of that and in addition, is easy to navigate making for a really positive user experience. Ready To Brief Us? Let's talk, we can help.
